cbirds is a module intended for demonstration purposes rather than a functional or pratical use.

The only way to make sense of function combinators in python would be in a pointfree context. 
Lucky for us, there is a [pointfree](https://pypi.org/project/pointfree/)
module that allows us, e.g., to compose functions smoothly and enable partial application of functions and methods.
